    <p>I woke up and decided to contribute.</p>
<p>At first I thought to write a technically oriented blog. And I started doing that. But then I didn't like the look or functionality of any of the blog platforms I tried. And settling for what someone else has built before is not very technically oriented, is it?</p>
<p>So then I thought I should write a blog, as in coding one. And I got started on such a project, using Python.</p>
<p>Holy crap that was a lot of work for the average night or weekend, even with all the raging parental horomones popping off these days. And the more I learned about templating languages, the more I realized I could create what I wanted by building a theme with Jinja... if only I found an existing platform to run that on top of. And one day, I did find such a thing.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, introducing THE IRONED CURTAIN, the world's first 7-bit website, a throwback to a simpler time when enemies became friends using 128 characters (TM). In addition to a blog, THE IRONED CURTAIN is a Pelican theme written by yours truly.</p>
<p>Click around and you'll see how fast everything loads, due to the distinct lack of the following.</p>
<p>distracting ads</p>
<p>pointless graphics</p>
<p>inneficient flash code</p>
<p>knee-jerk political pretense, completely forgettable within 24 hours</p>
<p>meaningless lists that add no value to the world</p>
<p>THE IRONED CURTAIN uses the origianal ASCII character set, as well as bold font-weight (e.g. for hyperlinks). That's it. The entire thing could be transcribed by an alcove of hipsters equipped with manual typewriters.</p>
<p>In THE IRONED CURTAIN I will cover a number of technical topics. An obvious category might relate to my work as a Programmer Analyst. But there are plenty of other things to discuss. On the internet there is a lot of technical content out there. Great content. But I hope when you read THE IRONED CURTAIN you find the perspective to be unique.</p>
