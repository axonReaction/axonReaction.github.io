	<p>I woke up and decided to contribute.</p>
<p>I thought to write a technically oriented blog. And I started doing that. But I didn't like the look or functionality of any of the blog platforms I tried. I could have simply settled or compromised for the existing solutions, but that would not be very technically oriented, would it?</p>
<p>So then I thought to write a blog, as in coding one. And I got started on such a project, using Python.</p>
<p>Holy crap that was a lot of work for the average night or weekend. But the more I learned about templating languages, like <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/">Jinja</a>, the more I realized I could create what I wanted by building a theme with a templating language, like Jinja... if only I could find a suitable platform to run that on top of. And one day, <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">I found it</a>.</p>
<p>Introducing <a class="reference external" href="http://ibowman.com/theironedcurtain">THE IRONED CURTAIN</a>, where enemies become friends using 128 characters (TM). In addition to the blog, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/axonReaction/tic">TIC</a> is a minimal Pelican theme written by yours truly, available for download on GitHub.</p>
<p>Click around on this blog and you'll see how fast everything loads. That is due to the distinct lack of the following.</p>
<p>distracting ads</p>
<p>pointless graphics</p>
<p>inefficient flash code</p>
<p>knee-jerk political pretense forgettable after 24 hours</p>
<p>meaningless lists that add no value to the world</p>
<p>THE IRONED CURTAIN uses the ASCII character set, as well as bold font-weight for hyperlinks. That's it. The entire thing could be transcribed by a hipster equipped with a manual typewriter.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, this blog will be about technology, sometimes. It will more of the time be about details. It is in details that we are all unique, and I promise you will find the content here to be unique, as well.</p>
