&lt;p&gt;I thought to write a technically oriented blog. And I started doing that. But I didn't like the look or functionality of any of the blog platforms I tried. I could have settled for someone else had built before, but that would not be very technically oriented, would it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I thought to write a blog, as in coding one. And I got started on such a project, using Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy crap that was a lot of work for the average night or weekend. But the more I learned about templating languages, like Jinja, the more I realized I could create what I wanted by building a theme with a templating language, like Jinja... if only I found an existing platform to run that on top of. And one day, I found it. The name of that platform is Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing THE IRONED CURTAIN, the world's first 7-bit website, where enemies become friends using 128 characters (TM). In addition to a blog, THE IRONED CURTAIN is a Pelican theme, written by yours truly and available for download on github.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click around on this blog and you'll see how fast everything loads. That is due to the distinct lack of the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;distracting ads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pointless graphics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inefficient flash code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;knee-jerk political pretense, completely forgettable after 24 hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meaningless lists that add no value to the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE IRONED CURTAIN uses the ASCII character set, as well as bold font-weight (e.g. for hyperlinks). That's it. The entire thing could be transcribed by a hipster with a manual typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;
