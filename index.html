	<p>I woke up and decided to contribute.</p>
<p>I thought to write a technically oriented blog. And I started doing that. Then I didn't like the look or functionality of any of the blog platforms I tried. And settling for what someone else has built before is not very technically oriented, is it?</p>
<p>So I thought to write a blog, as in coding one. And I got started on such a project, using Python.</p>
<p>Holy crap that was a lot of work for the average night or weekend. But the more I learned about templating languages, like Jinja, the more I realized I could create what I wanted by building a theme with a templating language, like Jinja... if only I found an existing platform to run that on top of. And one day, I found it.</p>
<p>Introducing THE IRONED CURTAIN, the world's first 7-bit website, where enemies become friends using 128 characters (TM). In addition to a blog, THE IRONED CURTAIN is a minimal Pelican theme.</p>
<p>Click around and you'll see how fast everything loads, due to the distinct lack of the following.</p>
<p>distracting ads</p>
<p>pointless graphics</p>
<p>inefficient flash code</p>
<p>knee-jerk political pretense, completely forgettable after 24 hours</p>
<p>meaningless lists that add no value to the world</p>
<p>THE IRONED CURTAIN uses the original ASCII character set, as well as bold font-weight (e.g. for hyperlinks). That's it. The entire thing could be transcribed by a hipster equipped with a manual typewriter.</p>
<p>In THE IRONED CURTAIN I will cover a number of technical topics. I hope when you read this blog you find the perspective to be unique.</p>
